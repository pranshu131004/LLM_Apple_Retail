# LLM_Apple_Retail
This project integrates a C program and a Python application to simulate product scanning in a retail setting. Using Streamlit for the UI, it displays product information and recommendations. The C program writes a simulated product ID to a file, which the Python app reads and processes to provide detailed product details.
